# Zig make a struct

Explore how to make a struct. This doesn't work I've created a
gist (http://bit.ly/2LK8Cql) and asked on irc:
https://irclog.whitequark.org/zig/2018-09-01#22961773

## Test
```bash
$ zig test make_struct.zig
```

## Clean
Remove `zig-cache/` directory
```bash
$ rm -rf ./zig-cache/
```
